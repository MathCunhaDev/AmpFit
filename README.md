# Ampfit Project Documentation

## Project Idea

Ampfit is a fitness progress tracker built to monitor and visualize your weekly workout progress.

### Tech Stack:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is known for its declarative nature and component-based architecture, making it easy to build interactive UIs.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides an incredibly fast development experience. It enables faster reloads and better support for modern JavaScript features.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality by providing compile-time checks, making the codebase more reliable and scalable.
- **Ant Design (Antd)**: A React UI library that provides a set of high-quality components for building enterprise-level applications. It ensures a polished, consistent design across the app.
- **React Query**: A powerful data-fetching and state management library that makes it easier to fetch, cache, and sync server state in React applications.
- **Chart.js**: A simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library that allows us to easily visualize the workout progress data through different types of charts.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for animations in React. It helps bring animations to the app, making it feel more interactive and dynamic.
- **Styled Components**: A library for writing CSS in JavaScript. It allows us to define component-level styles in a clean and efficient way, ensuring that the app's layout is responsive and maintainable.

Each of these tools was chosen for its excellent performance, ease of use, and ability to build scalable applications. Together, they allow for a highly interactive and responsive experience that helps users easily track their fitness progress.
